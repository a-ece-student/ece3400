 algorithm for real simulation code
 *  use wall sensors to see wher ethe walls are locally
 * translate local postion to global positon(that is going to be used by countring counters)
 * use the visited matrix to determine the current position and then use that current position to write to the wall matrix
 * determine where to go next and then update the visited matrix, and go to that position
