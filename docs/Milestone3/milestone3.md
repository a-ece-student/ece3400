 Real-time Maze mapping
 * For implementing the real-time algorithm fwe started by adding helper functions that would allow us to incorporate the additional wall
 sensors, backtracking, and mainly searching. 
 * Below are the major components of the code that will finally be used in order to implement depth first search algorithm.
      * Visited Matrix
      * Wall matrix
      
 
 
 
 * Helper functions
 * DFS
 * Demo
 algorithm for real simulation code
 *  use wall sensors to see wher ethe walls are locally
 * translate local postion to global positon(that is going to be used by countring counters)
 * use the visited matrix to determine the current position and then use that current position to write to the wall matrix
 * determine where to go next and then update the visited matrix, and go to that position
