The ultimate goal is to be able to map the robot's path through the maze on a screen using a FPGA and a VGA. In order to do this, the lab was split into multiple steps, each of which will help us achieve that ultimate goal in a later lab: 

- Reading external inputs to FPGA
- Correctly updating a 4-bit array dependent on the inputs 
- Drawing one box on the screen
- Description of how the DAC on the provided VGA connectors works and how the resistor values were chosen
- Mapping external inputs to four different outputs on the screen


## Reading external inputs to FPGA

First before we do anything further, we have to decide what we want to use to produce the external input. In the end, we decided to use the arduino, since this would allow for flexibility and easy manipulation of the output pins since we can code it all via Arduino programming. 

However, one note here is that the arduino pins output 5V, but the FPGA only accepts up to 3.3V. In order to make up for this difference, we used a voltage divider with resistances of roughly 800ohms and 500ohms to turn a 5V based output from the arduino into a 3.3V based input for the FPGA. ( [use this link to find resistor values for a voltage divider](http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/voltage-divider-calculator) )

FOr this first part, we basically want to show that the FPGA is reading the input from the arduino. We decided to do this by toggling one of the FPGA LEDs to turn on if the external input was running high, and off if the external input was low.

To review, we program the arduino outputs, which subsequently go through the voltage divider, which then enter the FPGA as an external input. We will then code the FPGA to toggle the LED on or off based on the external input. 


To best demonstrate this, we programmed the arduino pin to toggle from LOW to HIGH every 2 seconds using the following code within the loop:

```
  //External input to FPGA
  //should toggle from HIGH to LOW every 2 seconds
  
  digitalWrite(Pin1, LOW);         // sets the pin low
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);  //sets the LED low (just a marker)
  delay(2000);                     // waits for 2 seconds
  digitalWrite(Pin1, HIGH);        // sets the pin high
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); //sets the LED high (just a marker)
  delay(2000);                     // waits for 2 seconds

```

In our Verilog code for the FPGA, we merely had to equate the LED's current state, led_state, with the external input, such that the HIGH of the external input corresponds to the HIGH of the led_state, and the LOW with the LOW. We did this using the following code:
```
  always @ (posedge CLOCK_50) begin
        CLOCK_25 <= ~CLOCK_25; 
  		  if (GPIO_0_D[0]== 1'b0) begin
				led_state   <= 1'b0;
		  end
		  else if (GPIO_0_D[0]==1'b1) begin	
				led_state   <= 1'b1;
		  end 
	 end
```

Note in the above code, GPIO_O_D[0] was our external input and led_state refers to the LED's current state.

## Correctly updating a 4-bit array dependent on the inputs

This is similar to the external input to the FPGA with one added aspect. Since we want a 4 bit array, or essentially a 2 by 2 grid array, we can use two inputs from the arduino and map each part of the grid to the corresponding LED on the FPGA.

![](b1.png)

For the arduino code, we had two outputs, but we wanted to use these outputs to create a total of 4 combinations, as seen on the diagram. As such, we programmed it to toggle through LOW LOW, LOW HIGH, HIGH LOW, and finally HIGH HIGH for output pins 1 and two respectively. This can be seen in the following code.

```
  //4 bit array mapped to LEDs on FPGA
  //should iterate through 00, 01, 10, 11 
  //2 second intervals
  
digitalWrite(Pin1, LOW);      // sets both the pins low
digitalWrite(Pin2, LOW);      
delay(2000);                  // waits for 2 seconds

digitalWrite(Pin1, LOW);      // sets pin1 low
digitalWrite(Pin2, HIGH);     // sets pin2 high
delay(2000);                  // waits for 2 seconds


digitalWrite(Pin1, HIGH);     // sets pin1 high
digitalWrite(Pin2, LOW);      // sets pin2 low
delay(2000);                  // waits for 2 seconds


digitalWrite(Pin1, HIGH);     // sets both pins high
digitalWrite(Pin2, HIGH);     
delay(2000);                  // waits for 2 seconds
```
For the Verilog code, the only thing that would change is that we need to add another external input and equate it to a second led_state as seen in the following:

```
    always @ (posedge CLOCK_50) begin

        CLOCK_25 <= ~CLOCK_25; 
  		  if (GPIO_0_D[0]== 1'b0) begin
				led_state   <= 1'b0;
		  end
		  else if (GPIO_0_D[0]==1'b1) begin	
				led_state   <= 1'b1;
		  end 
		  
		  if (GPIO_0_D[1]== 1'b0) begin
				led_state2  <= 1'b0;
		  end
		  else if (GPIO_0_D[1]==1'b1) begin
				led_state2  <= 1'b1;
		  end

```

## Drawing one box on the screen

Drawing one box on the screen is independent of the work we've done so part, which we will add in later when we use external inputs to change what happens on the screen.

For this first part, we only need to program using Verilog. First from the VGA driver, we receive some pixel x and y coordinate which we declare as a wire in verilog as such:

```
    wire [9:0]  PIXEL_COORD_X; // current x-coord from VGA driver
    wire [9:0]  PIXEL_COORD_Y; // current y-coord from VGA driver
   
```

We then under structural coding added the following:

```
always @ (*) begin 
	  if(PIXEL_COORD_X < 10'd64 && PIXEL_COORD_Y < 10'd64) begin
		PIXEL_COLOR <= 8'b000_000_00;
	  end
	  else begin
		PIXEL_COLOR <= 8'b111_000_00;
	  end
end

```

which basically sets up a boundary, such that for each pixel from the VGA driver, if it is located somewhere inside of the 10'd64 box, it will be black, and else it will be a different color, red.

## Description of how resistor values were chosen

* We had three resistors for the red and green color output and two for the blue color output from the VGA.
* The resistor values were calculated using the concept of voltage division. 
* We calculated the voltage drop across the 50 Ohm resistor (labeled R4) by turning on only one resistor connected to the VGA pin. 
* The voltage drop across R4 was determined by the bit that is one and each bit generates an output voltage that is twice the voltage output of the next least significant bit. 
* For Red and Green colors

   ## Mapping external inputs to four different outputs on the screen.
   
Once we had completed the tasks of correctly updating a 4-bit array with inputs and drawing boxes on the screen, we were finally ready to combine all we had accomplished thus far and map the external inputs to outputs on the computer screen. 

We decided it would make sense to use a 2x2 grid as our output so that we can begin to work on what will eventually be a larger 4x5 grid in future labs. We declared an 8 bit 2x2 array named grid and then assigned each bit to a different color, which would correspond to a different location on the grid. 
   
   ![](ac.png)
   
We then used the code we had initially written to draw one box and updated it so that 4 boxes would appear in a 2x2 grid. Once we were satisfied with our 2x2 gridâ€™s appearance, we then added extra code connecting each box or grid location to our same Arduino external input. Our logic was that if the correct combination of external inputs was set high or low then not only will the LED light up, as was present in previous parts, but also the box corresponding to a location on the grid would be drawn.
