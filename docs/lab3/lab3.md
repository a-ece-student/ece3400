The ultimate goal is to be able to map the robot's path through the maze on a screen using a FPGA and a VGA. In order to do this, the lab was split into multiple steps: Reading external inputs to FPGA, correctly updating a 4-bit array dependent on the inputs, drawing one box on the screen, description of how the DAC on the provided VGA connectors works and how the resistor values were chosen, and mapping external inputs to four different outputs on the screen.


For the first part, we simply wanted to show that the
