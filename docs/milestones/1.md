# Milestone 1

## For this milestone, we have 2 important goals to acheive:
  * A robot that successfully follows a line of black tape.
  
  * A robot that successfully traverses a grid of black tape in a figure eight.
  
  
  

To complete this milestone, we first had to add line sensors to our original lab 1 prototype. Learn more about line sensors here: [line sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9453). We then made the robot follow the line of black tape before we were able to make it turn, and then subsequently make it go in a figure 8 pattern. 

Here is a diagram of our line sensor placement on the prototype:

1. Following a line
In order to make the robot follow a straight line, we first tested the different values the line sensor generates. The thresold value that separates black and white lines was 750. 

  * Black > 750
  * White < 750

The line following sensors were placed on the front side of the robot and were tied together to make the data captured by both as similar as possible. 

The algorithm compares the values generated by the the left and right middle sensors to enable the forward motion.
