Much of what we've done in the treasure detection part of this milestone was covered in the [second lab](https://lois-lee.github.io/Team-16/docs/lab2/lab2.html) so in order to find background information please refer back to the link.

The wall detection is done using a proximity sensor.

We added the short range distance sensing implementation to our previous from lab2. A digital pin was used to take input from the wall sensor. If the wall sensor detects a wall, we write 90 to the robots to stop them.
