#Meeting minutes

-**still working on lab 3**
-**Most of us came in last weekend to work on it**

-**Acoustic team done with square wave**

-**Graphics team got the box but has to backtrack to finish the points parts**



**Everyone is expected to come work on lab 3 on Thursday 10/12 (except Jidenna and Rohit because of prelims)**


**work split up among subteams**
GRAPHICS
1 point: Reading external inputs to FPGA
1 point: Correctly updating a 4-bit array dependent on the inputs
1 point: Drawing one box on the screen
1 point: Description of how the DAC on the provided VGA connectors works and how the resistor values were chosen.
4 points: Mapping external inputs to four different outputs on the screen

ACOUSTIC
1 point: Connecting the FPGA output to the speaker
2 points: Outputting a square wave to the speaker
4 points: Outputting a tune of at least three different frequencies to the speaker via an 8-bit DAC
