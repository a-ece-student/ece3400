# Displaying walls
In order to display the walls on the FPGA the first thing we need is to set up the SPI transmission from the Arduino. The Arduino sends a 16 bit signal to the FPGA. 
  * First 2 bits represent X axis position (0,1,2,3) and next three bits represent Y axis position ( 0,1,2,3,4) for drawing the 4     by 5 maze
